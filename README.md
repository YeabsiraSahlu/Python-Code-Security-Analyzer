# Python-Code-Security-Analyzer
Description:
The Python Code Security Scanner is a tool designed to automatically scan Python source code files for potential security vulnerabilities, with a focus on detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities. The tool utilizes Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to parse Python code and identify patterns indicative of insecure code constructions.

Key Features:

Flexible Scanning: The tool supports scanning individual Python files as well as entire directories recursively, allowing users to perform comprehensive security audits of their Python projects.

SQL Injection Detection: The tool employs a sophisticated SQL injection detection mechanism that identifies potential vulnerabilities by analyzing function calls that execute SQL queries. It searches for common SQL keywords such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, within function calls, providing insights into possible injection points.

Detailed Reporting: Upon completion of the scan, the tool generates a detailed report listing the file path, line number, and description of each potential vulnerability found. This enables developers to quickly locate and address security issues within their codebase.

Syntax Error Handling: The tool gracefully handles syntax errors encountered during code parsing, ensuring robustness and reliability even when scanning code with syntax issues.

Scalability and Extensibility: The tool's modular architecture allows for easy extension to support additional security checks beyond SQL injection, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and command injection. Developers can further customize and enhance the tool to meet specific project requirements.

Benefits:

Enhanced Code Security: By proactively identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities, developers can strengthen the security posture of their Python applications, reducing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors.

Time and Resource Efficiency: The automated nature of the tool streamlines the security auditing process, saving developers valuable time and resources that would otherwise be spent manually reviewing code for vulnerabilities.

Integration into Development Workflow: The Python Code Security Scanner can be seamlessly integrated into existing development workflows, enabling continuous security monitoring and ensuring that security considerations are prioritized throughout the software development lifecycle.

Overall, the Python Code Security Scanner empowers developers to adopt a proactive approach to security, fostering a culture of secure coding practices and mitigating potential risks associated with insecure code.
